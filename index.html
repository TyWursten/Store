            <h2 class="FoundingInfo">HyperY was founded by Ty Wursten. <br>
            Ty Wursten was a gamer that loved using HyperX equipment. <br>
            Ty soon came to the realization that only gamers on the horizontal axis could have fun. <br>
            This is how the HyperY was created. Now people on both axis' can have fun.
